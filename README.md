# Website guide 

## Webmaster responsibilities: 
- Serve as primary contact for website-related requests 
- Keep the BATC website up-to-date 
- Work with the BATC Chair and Student Representative to promote additional resources/opportunities on the website 
- Attend the Biomedical Acoustics Technical Committee meetings. These are held twice a year during the ASA conferences, with an option for virtual attendance. If you are unable to attend the meeting, please contact the Student Representative. This meeting is the primary way you will know about updates that need to be made on the website.  

## Tentative guidelines: 
- The webmaster will serve a 1-year term, running September through August, with the option to apply for an additional term.  

## When are website updates needed?  
- At the beginning of your term, make the following updates: 
- Homepage: Add "Biomedical Acoustics Webmaster" with your information (name, academic institution, and email) underneath the BATC Chair and Student Representative information 
- General Resources page: Update the webmaster link under Research Laboratories and Foundations
- After every ASA meeting, check to see if the following information needs updating: 
- Homepage: are the chair and student representative up to date? 
- Student Resources page: was there a Biomedical Acoustics Student Paper Award competition? If so, add the information on the winners. Contact Kevin Haworth for details (hawortkn@ucmail.uc.edu). 
- History page: are the chair and student representative up to date? Was anyone in the BATC given an award? 
- Directory page: were there any changes in the Biomedical Acoustics Committee Representatives? Are there any new ASA Fellows in Biomedical Acoustics? 

## Other updates 
- History page: Annual Reports should be linked when available 
- Optional Job Opportunities page: The BATC chair will send emails periodically listing job/post-doc openings. It could be nice to post these on the website, if there are no privacy concerns. In the past, the concern had been how long postings would be left up, but this could be solved by following the ASA Job Listing practice of leaving an ad up for a maximum of two months.
- Optional Homepage: The banner has images from publications in Biomedical Acoustics and links to those papers. These highlighted papers could be updated periodically.
- Get creative with other website updates! Propose any large changes to the BATC Chair and Student Representative.
