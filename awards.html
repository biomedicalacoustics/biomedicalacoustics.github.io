<h3>R. Bruce Lindsay Award</h3>
<p>The R. Bruce Lindsay Award, formerly called the Biennial Award, is presented in the spring to a member of the Society who is under 35 years of age on 1 January of the year of the Award and who, during a period of two or more years immediately preceding the award, has been active in the affairs of the Society and has contributed substantially, through published papers, to the advancement of theoretical or applied acoustics, or both. The following winners of the R. Bruce Lindsay Award have been associated with the BATC:</p>

<ul>
<li>2000 &ndash; Robin O. Cleveland &ndash; For contributions to nonlinear acoustics, particularly to shock wave lithotripsy.</li>
